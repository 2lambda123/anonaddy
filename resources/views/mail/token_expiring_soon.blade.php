# Your API token expires soon

One of the API tokens on your AnonAddy account will expire in **one weeks time**.</p>

If you are not using this API token for the browser extension or to access the API then you do not need to take any action.

If you **are using the token** for the browser extension please log into your account and generate a new API token and add this to the browser extension before your current one expires.

Once an API token has expired it can no longer be used to access the API.
